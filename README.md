in this project I made a store 
the user can navigate into the products without login the web site
if the user want to buy a product he has to sign in ,then he can buy.  
the products which have been selected became together in a cart.
the admin can see for every user the total cart and the total amount for him.

if you want to try this project 
first of all , create npx-react app and npm install .
then copy the folders in this project and paste them at yours project.
